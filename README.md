1. Two files: MA_Exer_PikesPeak_Males.txt and MA_Exer_PikesPeak_Females.txt
2. The python file, 2006_Pikes_Peak_10k_Race_analysis.py, is the file to run for exploring the dataset. It does a series of data cleaning steps, as the data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned in order to purform some analysis on it and create plots. 
3. As you will see in the python script, the primary packages used are Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Regular Expressions. There are also some empty values in the data and instead of imputing it, I removed all the rows that have more than 5 empty fields in it. 
4. The various ".png" files are the files created from the script, which includes boxplots and histograms, just to do a preliminary analysis on the data set and see its distribution by gender. 
5. Additional Info: The script produces a good amount of stdout print statements and each section is labeled appropriately to indicate what you're looking at. Also, in each section, the first output is the male dataset and the second is the female dataset.
